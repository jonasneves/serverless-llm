Best for: math, step-by-step thinking, algorithms.\n- reasoner-3 (Gemma 3 12B): Stronger instruction-following + safety. Best for: fact-checking, educational content.\n- reasoner-4 (Mistral 7B): Fast instruction-following, structured output. Best for: JSON generation, tool use.\n- reasoner-5 (Phi-3 Mini): Compact but capable reasoning.
